CNN Trained on Low Rank Reconstructed Images Using Singular Value Decomposition 

In this project I first built a converted to take the CIFAR-10 images and convert them into low rank approximations. 
I then build a standard CNN to classify the images. I wanted to know how well that a CNN would perform when dealing with less information.
